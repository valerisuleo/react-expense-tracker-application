# README: Expense Tracker Application

Welcome to the Expense Tracker Application repository. This application is built using React and various custom hooks and components to provide a dynamic user experience for managing personal expenses. The project demonstrates advanced practices in React development, including state management, forms handling, and table interactions. Below, you will find a detailed breakdown of the application's architecture, key functionalities, and how each part contributes to the overall functionality.

## Application Overview

The Expense Tracker allows users to add, edit, and delete expense records. It features a reactive form for input, a filterable table to display expenses, and the ability to sort and manage these expenses dynamically.

### Key Features

- **Add Expense:** Users can input expense details through a reactive form that validates inputs and manages state dynamically.
- **Edit and Delete Expenses:** Each expense can be modified or removed directly from the table via actions defined in the table's rows.
- **Filter Expenses:** Expenses can be filtered by category using a dropdown selector.
- **Dynamic Table Sorting:** The table headers support sorting, allowing users to order their expense records in ascending or descending order based on selected attributes.

### Technology Stack

- **React**: Used for building the user interface with functional components and hooks.
- **Custom Hooks**: `useReactiveForm` and `useTable` to handle form states and table operations, respectively.
- **CSS Frameworks**: Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness.

### Project Structure

1. **Custom Hooks and Utilities**
   - `useReactiveForm`: Manages the form state, validation, and interactions.
   - `useTable`: Handles data display in the table, including sorting and updates.

2. **Components**
   - `AlertsComponent`: Displays messages or alerts based on certain conditions, such as when no expenses are present.
   - `SelectComponent`: A reusable select box used for filtering expenses.
   - `TableComponent`: A dynamic table that displays expenses and allows for sorting and action triggers.

3. **Interfaces**
   - Various TypeScript interfaces are used to define the shapes of data, enhancing the type-safety and readability of the code.

4. **Configuration or Mock Data**
   - Sample data and configurations that dictate the behavior and initial display of the components.
